## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

Here is a sketch of DH-compatible reference frames.

Note that I have changed orientation of reference frame (3) so that X3 points in
the direction of origin (4). This is required to keep a3 positive, which, unlike d3, is
not signed distance, according to the lesson description.

The reference frame of the end effector (gripper) is aligned with the reference frame of
joint 6 so that only translation component along z axis is needed to be applied.

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Transformations | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1->0 | 0 | 0 | -0.75 | JOINTS[0]
2->1 | -pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + JOINTS[1]
3->2 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | pi + JOINTS[2]
4->3 |  pi/2 | 0.054 | -1.1 | pi + JOINTS[3]
5->4 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | JOINTS[4]
6->5 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | JOINTS[5]
EE->6 | 0 | 0 | 0.2305 | 0.0


#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
